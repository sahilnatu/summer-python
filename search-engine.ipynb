      "1: In every man`s heart there is a secret nerve that answers to the vibrations of beauty. - Christopher Morley\n",
      "2: I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. - Charles Dickens\n",
      "3: The heart has its reasons, of which the mind knows nothing. - Blaise Pascal\n",
      "4: `Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death. - Thomas Paine\n",
      "5: Show me your hands. Do they have scars from giving? Show me your feet. Are they wounded in service? Show me your heart. Have you left a place for divine love? - Fulton J. Sheen\n",
      "6: The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart. - Helen Keller\n",
      "7: Everybody can be great... because anybody can serve. You don`t have to have a college degree to serve. You don`t have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love. - Martin Luther King Jr.\n",
      "8: The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature. - Abraham Lincoln\n",
      "9: Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable. - C.S. Lewis\n",
      "10: We all wish to be judged by our peers, by the men `after our own heart.` Only they really know our mind and only they judge it by standards we fully acknowledge. Theirs is the praise we really covet and the blame we really dread. The little pockets of early Chrstians survived because they cared exclusively for the love of `the bretheren` and stopped their ears to the opinion of the Pagan society around them. But a circle of criminals, cranks, or perverts survives in just the same way; by becoming deaf to the opinion of the outer world, by discounting it as the chatter of outsiders who `don`t understand,` of the `conventional,` the `bourgeois,` the `Establishment,` of prigs, prudes, and humbugs. - C.S. Lewis\n"
